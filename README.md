# ruby-address-book
A Treehouse project, using Ruby to create a command-line address book program

In this project, which wraps up the Classes and Blocks portion of Treehouse's Ruby track, we were tasked with using OOP principles in Ruby to develop a basic address book. This is the first project I completed with Ruby using Class structures.

**TO RUN:**  Download and execute the file in Terminal by entering `ruby address_book.rb`.

*Classes*:<br>
**AddressBook**: Main class for the address book program. Runs the UI program.<br>
**Contact**: Class for contact records, containing name/address/phone number variables.<br>
**Address**: Class for addresses, containing an array of multiple types of addresses.<br>
**PhoneNumber**: Class for phone numbers, containing an array of multiple types of phone numbers.

*Provided files*: None<br>
*Project duration*: About 4 hours
